# landing-page
This project allowed me to encorporate all the basics of HTML and CSS elements. Using resources from The Odin Project and google, I was able to replicate (to the best of my ability) the page provided by The Odin Project. I learned an abundant amount of tools for Flexbox and I hope to use what I learned on future projects!
